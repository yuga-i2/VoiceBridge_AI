### THE PROBLEM (50 words)

₹2.73 lakh crore in government welfare benefits go unclaimed every year in India because the system waits for farmers to come to it. 135 million farmers are legally eligible for schemes like PM-KISAN, KCC, and PMFBY. Yet 70% receive zero rupees. Not from lack of information—from isolation. Sahaya changes that.

### WHAT SAHAYA DOES (80 words)

Sahaya calls farmers proactively on their basic 2G phones in Hindi. In one 3-minute call, the AI: (1) builds trust using real farmer success stories (Voice Memory Network), (2) asks 2 DTMF questions to check eligibility, (3) uses Bedrock Claude 3 to generate personalised scheme explanations, (4) sends an SMS checklist with required documents in Hindi, (5) schedules an automatic follow-up call in 3 days. No smartphone. No internet. No office visit. Just answer the phone.

### THREE INNOVATIONS (80 words)

**1. Proactive Outbound Calling.** Unlike every other solution, Sahaya reaches farmers first. They don't download apps or visit websites. Amazon Connect dials their number.

**2. Voice Memory Network.** When explaining PM-KISAN, Sahaya plays a 30-second voice clip—a real farmer from their district sharing their success story in their language. Peer trust beats official messaging every time.

**3. 2G Compatible & Literacy-Independent.** Works on a ₹500 Nokia. No internet, no reading. Just DTMF keypresses (1 or 2). Reaches 58% of rural India that has no smartphone.

### AWS SERVICES (50 words)

Eight production-grade AWS services, all live in ap-southeast-1: Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku for Hindi AI), Polly (Kajal neural voice), Transcribe (Hindi speech), DynamoDB (10 welfare schemes), S3 (Voice Memory clips), Connect (outbound calls), SNS (SMS), Lambda (serverless processing).

### IMPACT & ECONOMICS (40 words)

Cost per farmer: ₹15 (Sahaya) vs. ₹2,700 (traditional outreach). That is 180× cheaper. At 135 million farmers, this saves ₹36,000 crore. Break-even: 3 successful farmers pays for 100 calls. DPDP Act 2023 compliant—zero Aadhaar storage.
